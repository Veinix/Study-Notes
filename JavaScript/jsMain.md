> "Oh I've heard of that, it's like Java isn't it?"

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies - the other two being HTML and CSS. The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do things like store useful values inside variables, manipulate data and different data types, run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page and much more.
