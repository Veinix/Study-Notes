# Introduction

Hello there..

These are my notes that were taken while studying in John Bryce. It covers the topics learned in class, with additional information that I thought was relevant or helped me understand the concepts better.

I hope you have an easy time navigating these notes. If there are any problems, send me a message on Github or LinkedIn. Of course if you know me IRL - shoot me a text.

Happy Studying!
