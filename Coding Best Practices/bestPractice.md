## Variable Naming Convention

Variable naming is an important aspect in making your code readable. Naming variables follow a simple idea: Create variables that describe their function and which follow a consistent theme throughout your code. Different programming languages have different conventions for their variables.

### Multiword Delimited

This convention is to separate words in a variable name without the use of whitespace. Whitespace within variables is usually difficult for programming languages to interpret. Because of this variables must be delimited in some way. Here are several delimiting conventions commonly used in code:

* Snakecase: Words are delimited by an underscore.

``` js
variable_one
variable_two
```

* Pascalcase: Words are delimited by capital letters.

```js
VariableOne
VariableTwo
```

* Camelcase: Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word

```js
variableOne
variableTwo
```

* Hungarian Notation: This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words.

```js
arrDistributeGroup  //Array called “Distribute Group”
sUserName           //String called “User Name”
iRandomSeed         //Integer called “Random Seed”
```
