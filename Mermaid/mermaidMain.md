Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

It is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

For example the following code surrounded by a code block

```javascript
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

Creates this:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
